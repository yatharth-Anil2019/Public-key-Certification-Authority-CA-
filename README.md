# Public-key-Certification-Authority-CA-
we build a public-key CA, that responds to requests from clients that seek their own public-key certificates OR
that of other clients and build 2 clients that send requests to the CA for their own public-key certificates OR that of other clients, and exchange messages with each other in a confidential manner, or encrypted with public key of
receiver, but only after they know the other clientâ€™s public key in a secure manner.
